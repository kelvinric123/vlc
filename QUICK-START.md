# Quick Start Guide - RTM TV2 VLC Player

## The Right Way to Start (Step by Step)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ First Time Setup (Only Once)

**Step A: Check if VLC is installed**
```batch
check-vlc.bat
```

If not installed, download from: https://www.videolan.org/vlc/

**Step B: Configure VLC preferences**
```batch
setup-vlc-preferences.bat
```

This prevents VLC from auto-resizing to fullscreen. ‚≠ê **IMPORTANT!**

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Test VLC (Simple Mode)

```batch
play-vlc-simple.bat
```

This uses the most basic VLC options. If this works, you're good to go!

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Try Custom Size

Edit `play-vlc-custom.bat` and change these lines:
```batch
set WIDTH=640
set HEIGHT=480
set POS_X=0
set POS_Y=0
```

Then run:
```batch
play-vlc-custom.bat
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Measure and Adjust

Once VLC opens, you can see the window. Tell me:
- What size do you want? (width x height)
- What position? (x, y from top-left)

I'll update the batch file for you!

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "cmd line options invalid or no plugin"

**Solution:** Use the simple version first
```batch
play-vlc-simple.bat
```

Then run the setup:
```batch
setup-vlc-preferences.bat
```

### Problem: VLC still opens fullscreen

**Manual Fix:**
1. Open VLC normally (from Start Menu)
2. Go to `Tools` ‚Üí `Preferences`
3. Uncheck `Resize interface to video size`
4. Click `Save`
5. Close VLC completely
6. Try again: `play-vlc-custom.bat`

### Problem: Window size is wrong

Edit the batch file and change WIDTH/HEIGHT values:
```batch
notepad play-vlc-custom.bat
```

Change lines 13-14:
```batch
set WIDTH=1920    # Your desired width
set HEIGHT=1080   # Your desired height
```
